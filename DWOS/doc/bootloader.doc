What does a bootloader need to do?
	The bootloader has to bring the kernel, and everything that the kernel needs to boot strap into memory, switch to an environment that the kernel will like, and then hand control over to the kernel.
	Essentially, the bootloader just needs to be in protected mode.

Where will the kernel be loaded?
	We'll choose the 0x10000 physical address location. (ex=0x1000, bx=0, calling INT13h)
	We'll also choose that the kernel will be stored on the floppy disc at byte 0x1000. This should allow enough room for a bootloader second stage to prepare everything for the kernel.

Loading the kernel:
	We need to determine which partition to boot from
		Currently has one partition that will be loaded from. Future modifications will allow multiple paritions to be selected from.
	We need to determine where the kernel image is located on the boot partition
		Currently set as byte 512, or the section after the bootloader. This will be changed in the future to account for the space of a possible 2nd stage to the bootloader.
	Load the kernel image into memory (basic disk I/O)
	Enable protected mode
	Prepare the runtime environment for the kernel (setting up the stack space)
