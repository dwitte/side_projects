What does a bootloader need to do?
	The bootloader has to bring the kernel, and everything that the kernel needs to boot strap into memory, switch to an environment that the kernel will like, and then hand control over to the kernel.
	Essentially, the bootloader just needs to be in protected mode.

Where will the kernel be loaded?
	We'll choose the 0x10000 physical address location. (ex=0x1000, bx=0, calling INT13h)

Loading the kernel:
	We need to determine which partition to boot from
	We need to determine where the kernel image is located on the boot partition
	load the kernel image into memory (basic disk I/O)
	enable protected mode
	prepare the tunetime environment for the kernel (setting up the stack space)
